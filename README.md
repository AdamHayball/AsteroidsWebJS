# AsteroidsWebJS

This is a clone of the classic Asteroids game built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. It features:

- **Levels**: The game difficulty increases as you progress through levels.
- **Score Tracking**: Your score increases based on the asteroids you destroy.
- **Asteroids**: As the level increases, more asteroids spawn with varying sizes and speeds.
- **Particles**: Explosions and ship collisions create particle effects.

## Features:
- Movement: Use the arrow keys to rotate and thrust the spaceship.
- Shooting: Press the spacebar to shoot bullets.
- Level progression: As you clear the screen of asteroids, the game progresses to the next level with more asteroids and increased difficulty.
- Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the ship, asteroids, and bullets.

## How to Play:
1. The spaceship moves with the arrow keys (left, right, up).
2. Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at asteroids.
3. Avoid colliding with asteroids. If the ship is destroyed, the game restarts at level 1.
4. Destroy all asteroids to move to the next level. The game continues to get harder as the levels progress.
